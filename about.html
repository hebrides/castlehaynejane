      <h2 class="about-title">About Jane</h2>
      <p>I majored in history in college, and have always had an interest in arts history, especially film; I have a knack for communication, and don't mind writing essays (watch out, chatGPT!).  I have worked in education as a standardized test grader and in agriculture most of my life, and as a full-time Mom. I balance business and life endeavors, including the farm, the family estate, AirBnB management (Superhost in one year, baby!), a score of pets, and our household of three teenage boys, with the help of my dashingly handsome, talented & hard-working husband, David Tucker Hill.</p>
